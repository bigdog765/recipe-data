            "If you are using whole, fresh anchovies you must clean them first. Pull off the heads and pull out the insides. Then rinse with clean water.",
            "Pour the olive oil into a small deep saucepan set over heat. Use a deep fry thermometer to monitor the heat.Meanwhile, add the eggs to a small bowl and beat until well mixed.",
            "Add the flour, cayenne, salt and black pepper to a shallow bowl, use a fork to mix the ingredients together. Dip the fish one at a time into the beaten eggs and then roll it in flour.When the oil reaches 365 degrees F. fry the fish a few at a time, rolling them around in the oil to assure even cooking until they are golden brown (about 5-8 minutes).",
            "Serve with crusty bread, extra-virgin olive oil for dipping the bread (optional) and tomatoes."

            "Slice bread into 1cm thick slices: you can toast them or use them as they are. I prefer a soft bread to exalt butter softness.",
            "Spread butter with generosity over the bread.If you want to use salted anchovies, rinse them under running water to remove extra salt and divide them into fillets, removing all the bones. If you use anchovies in oil, just make two fillets out of them and lay them over buttered bread.And now, the final touch: a pickled baby caper in the centre, and - in less than 3 minutes - you have an unusual afternoon break or a fun anti-crisis and anti-panic appetizer for Christmas."
